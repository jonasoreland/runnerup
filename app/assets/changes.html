        #830 Various workout improvements
        <p>The current functionality has been reviewed. A lot of the workout features
          are implied, like that autopause and autolap only were implemented in basic workouts as well as
          most audio cues only for Active steps.
        <p>Where documentation was sufficient, it was clarified in settings.
          If not possible to document, the functionality was modified so it could be described.
        <ul>
          <li>Settings: Reorder and group related options for workout and audio cue options (some settings moved from recording)
            <br>Add summary for many options to clarify usage
          <li>Autopause: Allow in warmup/cooldown steps
          <li>Periodic time/distance audio feedback: Allow in all steps
          <li>Autolap: Allow in activity last steps (not just active)
          <li>Countdown: Enable for all targets with duration.
            <br>Previously only available for rest/recovery targets.
            <br>Also add countdown in the GUI.
          <li>Tweak to defaults for intervals
          <li>Interval: Use recovery also for Time targets, if configured.
          <li>No auto conversion for Resting steps in workouts (set Resting or Recovery)
          <li>Use recovery also for countdown steps
          <li>Step completion: Complete if current point is expected to be closer to the target.
            <br>Previously, the target were reached only when exceeding the target.
            So if distance was 1000 m, the step was only completed if over 1000m
            Similar for time, so average could be 1:01.
            Time/distance targets are now handled similar to autolap changed recently,
            so the current point is used if it is expected to be closer to the target
            than next point, based on the previous point.
          <li>RepeatStep: Avoid exception if no steps
          <li>Target Feedback: Incorrect use of Activity
          <li>GraceTime: Reset when conditions are OK also if no feedback
          <li>ManageWorkouts: Expand list by default
        </ul>
      <li>
        #829 Notification: Add Lap and Pause/Resume buttons
        <ul>
          <li>Control activities from lockscreen
          <li>Refresh UI when workout has ended
          <li>LapButton: Keep enabled also for last step
        </ul>
      <li>
        #826 HR strap fixes
        <ul>
          <li>Delay disconnect at HrValue 0, handle bad behaving HR straps better
          <li>HR scanning simplifications: Preselect first device when scanning etc
          <li>HRMStateChangeFeedback: Must use cue language
        </ul>
      <li>#828 Transifex Finnish update (most of UI translated now)</li>
      <li>#825 HRM state audio cue not transmitted</li>
      <li>#824 Disable Media button control in Lollipop and later.
        <br>Not working in Lollipop (and even earlier?), can only be used with Media applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        #821 Workout fixes
        <ul>
          <li>Formatting: Present >= 0.99 as km
          <li>Format of time without unit: Do not always speak minutes cue
          <li>Repeat: Default and max value tweak
          <li>Avoid exceptions for steps size==0
        </ul>

    <p>Second alpha for 2.0, built with release keys.
    <h2>v1.90.1</h2>
    <p>First alpha release for 2.0. This build appears as a separate application and should be
      possible to use in parallel to the standard Play build.
    <p>The major feature in 2.0 is a refreshed user interface using material design. This also
      includes an updated app icon.
    <p>The first 2.0 release still supports Android from Froyo. This is likely the last release for
      older Android releases, development is expected to target 5.0 or at least 4.2 further on.
    <p>Note: The database format is slightly changed in 2.0. There is however an experimental 1.58.1
      on GitHub that should allow usage of the 2.0 database if reverting to 1.58 for some reason.
    <p>There has been many larger and smaller other changes. Some references to GitHub pull
      requests.
