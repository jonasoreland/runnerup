<p>RunnerUp records location (GPS) when an activity is started, as well steps (for cadence).
<br>The recording is done also when the app is in background (a notification is always shown when location is enabled)
</br>
<br>A user can export this information to accounts (files or web services), the information is not shared in any other way.

<p>The external accounts have separate privacy policies.</p>
<p>Note that usage of the map has a separate policy: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy">MapBox privacy policy</a></p>
