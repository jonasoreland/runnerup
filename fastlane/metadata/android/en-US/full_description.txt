Upload your activities to a variety of running sites with a single click:

Explanation to anti-features:

* NonFreeNet: Uploading to Strava and other services makes use of non free net services. (The uploading is open similar to uploading a .tcx file, but the services are not open.)
* UpstreamNonFree: The Play version (can be installed at the same time as the F-Droid version) has additional features using non free libraries, see below

Features removed compared to Play version:

* Map view (OsmDroid instead of MapBox, no MapBox API key in free)
* WearOS app (requires non-free Play services)
* HR ANT+ connectivity (requires closed source lib)
* Runalyze and Dropbox upload (Requires API keys. Runalyze test upload possible.)
* Download customized apk to device (F-Droid binary is universal for all supported binaries).
